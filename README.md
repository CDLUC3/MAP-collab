Community space for partners to add in files, code, prototypes, and other materials to share with others.  See [Contribution Guidlines here](https://github.com/CDLUC3/MAP-collab/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

You can also start conversations in the Discussions tab.

This community space was created as a result of requests from MAP pilot workshop participants (September 2025) for a place to collaborate and share resources and outcomes from their work exploring machine actionable data management plan use and integrations.

<strong>About the Machine Actionable Plans (MAP) Pilot</strong>

The California Digital Library (CDL) and ARL partnered on a two-year pilot program to address the urgent needs of academic and research libraries to meet increasing requirements for sharing research data. Funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services [IMLS LG-254861-OLS-23](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-254861-ols-23)], the project piloted a range of strategies, including technical integrations, automation, and cross-departmental collaboration, to connect data management plans with existing research and IT systems and strengthen research support. 

The pilot worked directly with ten institutions, providing the opportunity to take the infrastructure built by the DMP Tool and implement pilot machine-actionable approaches in alignment with their organization’s goals. Each institution designed its projects with consideration given to local data management challenges and opportunities. Some focused on technical developments using API integrations, including automation and tool development, while others focused on collaboration and relationship-building across departments in support of research data management. 

Several [resources for institutions](https://bit.ly/mappilot) have been created as a result of the pilot outcomes, including a report, key recommendations, case studies, and a series of recorded webinars.

We invite anyone with an interest and work in developing maDMPs for institutions to contribute their resources and share their experiences in this space.
